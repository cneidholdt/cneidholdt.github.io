<title>Welcome to Carley Neidholdt's Website</title>

My name is Carley Neidholdt. I live in Keytesville, Missouri. It is a tiny rural town that I am sure
 no one has heard of before. For reference I am about an hour and a half drive from Columbia, MO. 
 Thank goodness for online learning. I am currently a first year Kindergarten teacher. I am working 
 towards my Bachelors of Science in Elementary Education. I do not have any previous web application or 
 development training or experience. I am looking forward to finding out what all I learn. I am definitely 
 not the most tech savvy person. In this course I hope to learn the basics of web design and coding considering
  I have no experience. I may be completely wrong but I'm hoping that this class will give me a better
   understanding and in my free time I can create a website for teachers pay teachers. In my free time you 
   can normally find me spending time with friends and family, camping, and enjoying time outside.Â

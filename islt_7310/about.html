<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>

<p> Once again, my name is Carley Neidholdt. I was born and raised in Keytesville,
     MO which is where I graduated high school. I am a first year teacher teaching
      Kindergarten at a local Catholic school. I am 22 years old and recently engaged. 
      I received my Associates of Arts Degree at Moberly Area Community College. I am currently 
      studying to receive my Bachelor of Science Degree specializing in Elementary Education. I am 
      currently studying at the University of Missouri (online) for the time being. That will soon 
      change as I can’t get my degree online in this program. My estimated completion date is the
       summer of 2023. Considering I am teaching full time it is taking me a little longer to 
       graduate. One of my favorite quotes is <blockquote“If at first you don’t succeed, try again”. I feel like
        this is a very good quote for day-to-day life.></blockquote> </p>

<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
<p> Again, my name is Carley Neidholdt. I was born and raised in
    <b>Keytesville</b>, MO which is where I graduated high school. I am a first year 
    teacher teaching Kindergarten at a local Catholic school. I am 22 years old 
    and recently engaged. I received my Associates of Arts Degree at Moberly 
    Area Community College. I am currently studying to receive my Bachelor of 
    Science Degree specializing in <em>Elementary</em> Education. I am currently studying 
    at the University of Missouri (online) for the time being. That will soon 
    change as I can’t get my degree online in this program. My estimated 
    completion date is the summer of 2023. Considering I am teaching full time it
     is taking me a little longer to graduate.</p>

<h2>Let's Learn Page </h2>
<h2><a id= "Goal1"> Goal 1</a></h2>
   <p> My first goal is to help each learner reach their potential. When it comes to your 
    first job and teaching a concept, I feel that it can be very daunting. Just
    downright overwhelming. I know that I sure was overwhelmed when I 
    first glanced at my curriculum mapping for the year. It is not something taught when
    studying to go into education. Or, in my case I haven’t enrolled in a class yet to 
    teach me that. I feel like we learn about all different types of learners but we aren’t 
    taught how to actually teach them a concept. I hope that my website can do that for you. 

 </p>

 <h2><a id= "Goal2"> Goal 2</a></h2>
    <p> My second goal for my learners is to get them prepared for what they are teaching. 
    Study the curriculum, look through it before you teach it to your students. There may be 
    parts you want to change to fit your students better. There may be things you want to
    implement. Make sure that it fits somewhere within your teaching standards. As a first
    year teacher this is very important. It gets you prepared for the job you signed up to do.
    As the years go on you will know it like the back of your hand. Until then be prepared.
    </p>

<h2><a id= "Goal3"> Goal 3</a></h2>
     <p>  My third goal is to give my learners ideas on how to introduce a concept. There are many 
     ways to introduce a concept to where it is exciting for your learners. Some lessons may already 
     come with a plan on what to do but, if you are creating your own it can be a little daunting.
     Here are 4 ways that I introduce a concept in my classroom. Introduce with audio or video. 
     This works great for any grade level in my opinion. Introduce with pictures, illustration or
     artifacts. Introduce with poetry, or a book. I’ve learned this works very well for my age group. 
     Lastly introduce with a challenge or question. From my experience this really gets them intrigued. 
    </p>
